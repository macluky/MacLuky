// To the best of my knowledge, the InternalButtonLight module does not actually work,
// and becomes a useless resource drain. It definitely isn't actually being used anywhere.
// The internalGeneric module is likewise unnecessary for normal IVA function and explicitly doesn't do anything 
// -- yet Unity wastes resources enumerating it, not much, but why do it at all?

// This patch cuts both of them out of all the stock props to reduce component count.
