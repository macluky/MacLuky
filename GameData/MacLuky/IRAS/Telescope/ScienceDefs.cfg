	RESULTS
	{
		default = An accurate reading of the local infrared signature is recorded.
		default = Local variations in the infrared signature are detected.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Initial scans are blurred by a large infrared signature surrounding Kerbin, we should definetely lower our room temperature.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Kerbin's infrared signature spans several planetary radii, you wonder if it can warm your space probe
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Interactions with the solar wind significantly distort Kerbin's infrared signature, resulting in a picture that reminds you of a pear.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The beryllium mirror is properly calibrated and records Kerbin's surface level infrared signature.
		KerbinSrfLanded = The beryllium mirror records an accurate reading of Kerbin's surface infrared signature.
		MunInSpaceHigh = A weak infrared signature indicates that the Mun may once have contained a molten core.
		MunInSpaceLow = Localized infrared signatures are detected over several regions of the Mun's surface.
		MinmusInSpace = Frozen ice cream doesn't emit a infrared signature dummy.
		SunInSpaceLow = Sensors overloading... oh dear, I think the mirror is melting.
		SunInSpaceHigh = Kerbol's enormous infrared field extends well beyond the orbit Eeloo, affecting all of the planets in the solar system.
		MohoInSpace = Scans indicate only a weak induced infrared signature, this is most likely caused by Kerbol heating the surface of the planet.
		EveInSpaceLow = Intense infrared signatures nearly overload the sensors.
		EveInSpaceHigh = A strong infrared signature baffles the scientists.
		GillyInSpace = Gilly has a strong infrared signature, wait! stop holding a candle that close to the telescope.
		DunaInSpaceLow = Isolated patches of Duna's turn out to be specks of goo that contaminated the mirror during production.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = Duna's infrared signature reveal hotspots that require deeper investigation.
		IkeInSpace = Cold, dead, lifeless, no readings of interest here.
		DresInSpace = Well that is unexpected? someone comes to Dres?
		JoolInSpaceLow = Jool's strong magnatic signature interferes with your readings, either that or someone added space invaders to the operating system.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool imagery shows images of alien spacecraft.
		LaytheInSpace = Looks nice and warm down there.
		VallInSpaceHigh = Only Jool's infrared signature is detectable here, suggesting that Vall lacks any geo activity.
		VallInSpaceLow = A very weak infrared signature is detected in low orbit of Vall. This is perhaps due to Vall's mysteriously liquid, sub-surface oceans.
		TyloInSpace = Tylo causes the onboard computer to reboot.
		BopInSpaceHigh = Bop produces a strong infrared hotspot on a further dead surface; much further study is warranted...
		BopInSpaceLow = Bop's infrared signature not visible at this altitude.
		PolInSpace = Sensors show nothing unususal, then again that in itself is unusuall.
		EelooInSpace = The gyroscopes start spinning, apparenly a 12 bit computer has its limitations.
